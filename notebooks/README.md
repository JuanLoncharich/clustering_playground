# ðŸ“‚ notebooks/

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Algorithm testing
- Visualization of clustering results
- Prototyping before moving logic to scripts or modules

Each notebook is named with a prefix to maintain order, e.g., `01_exploration_dataset1.ipynb`, `02_kmeans_vs_dbscan.ipynb`.

These notebooks are not meant to be part of the production pipeline but serve as an interactive and visual tool for development.
