# ðŸ“‚ results/
This folder stores outputs generated by clustering experiments.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a dataset and may include:
- Cluster visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps)
- Evaluation scores (e.g., silhouette, Davies-Bouldin)
- Optionally, saved models (e.g., pickle files)

Structure example:

```plaintext
results/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset1/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ clusters_plot.png
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ silhouette_scores.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ model_kmeans.pkl
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ dataset2/
```
 
This separation makes it easier to compare algorithms across datasets.
