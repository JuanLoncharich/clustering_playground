# ðŸ“‚ experiments/

This directory contains experiment scripts that apply clustering algorithms to specific datasets.

Each script typically includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Execution of clustering algorithms
- Evaluation and visualization
- Saving outputs to the `results/` directory

Example:
- `experiment_dataset1.py`: Runs various clustering methods on `dataset1`.

You can run a script directly from the command line:

```bash
python experiments/experiment_dataset1.py
```
