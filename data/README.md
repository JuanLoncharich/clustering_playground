# 📂 data/

This directory contains all datasets used in the project.

- `raw/`: Unmodified original datasets as downloaded or collected.
- `processed/`: Cleaned, preprocessed, or transformed versions of the raw data, ready for use in clustering experiments.

⚠️ Do not modify the files in `raw/`. If you apply cleaning or transformations, store the output in `processed/`.

Organizing data this way ensures reproducibility and prevents accidental loss of original data.
